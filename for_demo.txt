1) Set the following
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/u/shaukata/MastersClass/packages
2) Run reset_head package
3) check whether the clock are updated or not. If not run sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org in every terminal
4) launch " launch_1.launch " (from Masters Class Launch File) which will launch openni camera/tracker , and broadcasts static tranforms for the kinect
5) launch " launch_pointing.launch " (from Masters Class Launch File) which will launch marker_extension, head_movement and pointing_pr2cpp
6) In RVIZ, make sure that target frame is "/openni_depth_frame" and Fixed Frame is "/Odom_combined" . However it doesn't matter. And tick all the fields in TF panel which will let you visualise the output from kinect tracker and visualisers
7) Make sure that teleop is not running as it will cause jitter while the robot follow pointing.
